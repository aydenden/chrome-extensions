## Classification Categories

## Output Format
Respond ONLY with a JSON object (no markdown code blocks):
{
  "category": "WANTED|BLIND|DART",
  "subCategory": "JOB_POSTING|COMPANY_PROFILE|COMPENSATION|SALARY_REVIEW|COMPANY_REVIEW|INTERVIEW_REVIEW|FINANCIAL_STATEMENT|DISCLOSURE",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this classification was chosen"
}

## Guidelines
1. Use high confidence (>0.8) only when clear indicators are present
2. Use medium confidence (0.5-0.8) for ambiguous cases
3. Use low confidence (<0.5) when the text is unclear or insufficient
4. Reasoning should be concise (1-2 sentences)
5. Focus on key indicators: domain-specific terminology, document structure, content type
